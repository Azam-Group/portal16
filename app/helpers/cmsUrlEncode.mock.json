This analysis involves normalizing the data for the species against all data collected for the group (currently only supporting Lepidoptera, but will support any higher taxon of the species). By normalizing against the group, the analysis attempts to compensate for biases in sampling effort. In many cases this will work well, but in other cases this may provide misleading insights – however, by providing a transparent view of the process, the user can judge if there appears to be sufficient data to investigate further.\r\n\r\n![screenshot-1](http://cms.gbif.org/sites/default/files/documents/species-populations-demo1.png \"Screenshot 1\")\r\n\r\n> This project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh\r\n> Programme for research, technological development and demonstration\r\n> under grant agreement No 308454. © 2012 EU BON.
